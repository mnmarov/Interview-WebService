To open Task 1 and 2

Task1and2\EDIFACT_XML\EDIFACT_XML.sln

There are 2 methods:

ParseEDIFACT and ParseReferences

Both read the input files from the binary's location and output the result in the console.

To open Task 3

Task3\WebService\WebService.sln

I am using a library I wrote a while back for a self hosted web service.
It should work out of the box but if you have trouble starting it open visual studio as administrator.
The security is disabled so just press login.
It has a web interface for ease of use.

Usage:
1. Run the solution and the login page will open.
2. Press Login button.
3. Press the "Upload XML text" button
4. You will get the result displayed.

You can modify the xml to see different result e.g. Command="DEFAULT1" will result in:

"Message": "Invalid command specified.",
"Status": -1
